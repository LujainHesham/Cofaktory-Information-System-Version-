**Cofaktory Carbon Emissions Monitoring System 🌍☕**

A fictional information system for tracking and reducing carbon emissions across 5 coffee factory branches in Egypt.

📌 **Project Overview**
Cofaktory is an imaginary industrial information system designed to measure, monitor, and reduce carbon emissions for a fictional coffee factory with 5 branches across Egypt. The system enables users to track emissions from coffee production, packaging, and distribution, generate carbon footprint reports, and implement reduction strategies to align with global climate goals.

🎯 **Key Features**
**Role-Based Access Control:**

1. **Admins:** Full system control, user management, and reduction plan oversight.
2. **Managers:** Generate tactical/strategic reports and analyze emissions trends.
3. **Data Entry Officers:** Input production, packaging, and distribution data.

**Carbon Footprint Calculation:**
Track emissions from waste, transportation, and production processes. Calculate emissions using metrics like fuel efficiency, material quantities, and vehicle distances.

**Reduction Plan Management:**
Propose cost-effective strategies (e.g., waste reduction, energy efficiency). Track implementation costs and projected annual profits.

**Dynamic Reporting:**
Generate time-bound reports for managers (e.g., monthly/quarterly emissions).

**Skills:** Microsoft SQL Server · Microsoft Access · Database Management System (DBMS) · Database Design · SQL
